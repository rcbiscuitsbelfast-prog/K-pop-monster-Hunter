DESKTOP ICON UPDATES

The desktop launcher references these icon files:
- desktop_icon128.png
- desktop_icon32.png  
- desktop_icon16.png

These should also be updated to match the new purple K theme for consistency.

The desktop icons should use the same design as the mobile app icon:
- Purple background (#8A2BE2)
- Bold white "K" in the center
- Clean, modern appearance

Update both the mobile and desktop icons to maintain brand consistency across platforms.
