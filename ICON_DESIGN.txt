NEW APP ICON DESIGN

The new app icon should be a simple, modern design featuring:

1. Background: Solid purple color (#8A2BE2 or similar vibrant purple)
2. Letter: Large, bold, white letter "K" 
3. Style: Clean, minimalist design
4. Shape: Square with rounded corners (standard Android app icon format)
5. Sizes needed: 48x48, 72x72, 96x96, 144x144, 192x192 pixels

The icon should replace the current shamrock image and represent the "K-Pop Monster Hunter" theme.

To create this icon:
1. Use a graphics editor like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools like Canva
2. Create a square canvas with the specified dimensions
3. Fill with purple background
4. Add a bold white "K" in the center
5. Export as PNG files for each size
6. Replace the ic_launcher.png files in each drawable directory

This will give the app a modern, distinctive appearance that matches the new name and theme.
